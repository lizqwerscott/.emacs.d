(autoload 'sly-asdf-flymake-base-mode "sly-asdf-flymake-base" "\
Toggle Sly-Asdf-Flymake-Base mode on or off.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable Sly-Asdf-Flymake-Base mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil, and toggle it if ARG is `toggle'.

Sly-Asdf-Flymake-Base is an Emacs minor mode for on-the-fly syntax checking.
Sly-Asdf-Flymake-Base collects diagnostic information from multiple sources,
called backends, and visually annotates the buffer with the
results.

Sly-Asdf-Flymake-Base performs these checks while the user is editing.  The
customization variables `sly-asdf-flymake-base-start-on-sly-asdf-flymake-base-mode',
`sly-asdf-flymake-base-no-changes-timeout' and
`sly-asdf-flymake-base-start-syntax-check-on-newline' determine the exact
circumstances whereupon Sly-Asdf-Flymake-Base decides to initiate a check of
the buffer.

The commands `sly-asdf-flymake-base-goto-next-error' and
`sly-asdf-flymake-base-goto-prev-error' can be used to navigate among Sly-Asdf-Flymake-Base
diagnostics annotated in the buffer.

The visual appearance of each type of diagnostic can be changed
in the variable `sly-asdf-flymake-base-diagnostic-types-alist'.

Activation or deactivation of backends used by Sly-Asdf-Flymake-Base in each
buffer happens via the special hook
`sly-asdf-flymake-base-diagnostic-functions'.

Some backends may take longer than others to respond or complete,
and some may decide to disable themselves if they are not
suitable for the current buffer. The commands
`sly-asdf-flymake-base-running-backends', `sly-asdf-flymake-base-disabled-backends' and
`sly-asdf-flymake-base-reporting-backends' summarize the situation, as does the
special *Sly-Asdf-Flymake-Base log* buffer.
