;;; Commentary:
;;;       Add or change the configurations in custom.el, then restart Emacs.
;;;       Put your own configurations in custom-post.el to override default configurations.
;;; Code:

(custom-set-variables
 )

(custom-set-faces
 ;; custom-set-faces was added by Custom.
 ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
 ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
 ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
 )

;; custom.el ends here
